                <h2>Glory glory Man united!</h2>
        
        <p>A club you support is usually an embodiment of you and the feeling when I wear the red jersey and scream my hearts out after each goal and the thrill my nerves feel during those 90 minutes of the game is something I can find nowhere else.</p> 
         
        <p>As Dennis Bergkamp once said, <q><i><strong>When you start supporting a club, You don’t support it because of the trophies,or a player, or history. You support it because you found yourself somewhere there; found a place where you belong.</strong></i></q></p>
        
        <p>Hey there, my name is Aaryan and if you know me, then you already know that I'm a die-hard fan of <strong>Manchester United FC</strong>. But what you don't know is how I became one.</p> 
      
        <p>Well, it was the year 2010. Back then I used to watch football with my cousin, but didn’t know a single thing about it rather than 2 teams with 11 players struggle to push the ball back in the net with their foot and sometimes with their head. One following day, Manchester United were up against Arsenal at the Old Trafford, my cousin who is also a United fan was very much excited and enthusiastically answering my questions about Manchester United. The match was end to end with countless chances for both the sides as United beat Arsenal by 2–0 deficit. What moved me more was United's fearless counter attacking football, catching the opposition on the break, the quick passes, intelligent runs and tumbling down on the grass due to nasty tackles by the rivals and yet getting up again and not stopping until the final whistle of the game.</p>
        
        <p>The Red Devils' never-say-die attitude, the opponents always knew that the game is on till the last minute, that a game against United was never won till the final whistle. The feeling of joy after winning those games with a last minute winner is just unparalleled. For example the last minute goal from Michael Owen against our arch rivals Manchester City in 2009–10 season just a few seconds earlier from the referee’s ending whistle. Or the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final penalty shootout against Chelsea or Wayne Rooney's bicycle goal in 2–1 win over Manchester City in 2012. No one can ever write them off, United may've lost it's identity over the last few years but it still inspires fear, and hate amongst most rival clubs' fans.   The psychological trick of <q><strong>Fergie Time</strong></q> is the most incredibly motivating (and opponent demoralising) thing I've seen in sport. I never say never, so did United.</p>
        
        <p>The 2020/21 season will be kickin off soon and it was only now while writing this that I realised the upcoming season will mark a decade of me following this football club. Over all these years, I've have seen it all, the glory days of Manchester United winning all the major trophies, the hard times post <strong>Sir Alex</strong>'s retirement and even now when things are again started to take definite shape again under manager <strong>Ole Gunnar Solksjaer</strong>. I always felt a strong yet unscrutable connection with this club. It's the ultimate goal of my life to visit <strong>The Theatre of Dreams</strong>, the mighty <strong>Old Trafford</strong> to see United play one day.</p>

        <p class="poem">United is my team, not because they win,<br> but for the character they show,<br>

    They seem to respond every time when they are low,<br> they turn the tables even when they are out of flow,<br>
          
    This started from the year 1958, when the Busby Babes went on a plane,<br>

    The tragedy that followed left everyone in pain, Jimmy was shocked and in disdain.<br>

    He never backed-off and showed his brain, he never lost his focus,and Sir Matt Busby’s aim,<br>

    The actions that he took, didn’t go in vain,<br>
          
    In a few days time, Manchester United started playing again.<br><br>

    The spirit that he showed, picked off,<br>

    The tradition of fighting back was what the teams at United carried on.<br>

    Rio Ferdinand said,that not giving up is in the DNA of the team,<br>

    That is because they come back strongly, when they are out of steam.<br>

    Managers have changed, but the formula remained,<br>

    Keep playing your heart out, till the final whistle of the game,<br>

    The players keep their focus on the game, despite their fame,<br>

    And this is the reason for all the titles we have gained.<br><br>

    United are the team for me,<br>

    Not because they win, but for the character they show,<br>

    They seem to respond every time when they are low,<br>
          
    They turn the tables when they are out of flow,<br>

    Leaving the opponents open their mouth in awe.<br><br>
